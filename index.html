        <p>Hi, I'm Tyler, I write poems & stories, make music, and design things.</p> 
        <p>I'm currently reading <a href="https://www.goodbooks.io/books/art-and-fear">Art & Fear</a> by David Bayles and Ted Orland, and listening to <a href="https://florabelle.bandcamp.com/album/wants-a-diamond-pivot-bright"> Wants a Diamond Pivot Bright</a> by M. Sage.</p>
        <p>You can read some of my creative writing in <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/tyly/my+garden+(publish)/welcome+to+my+garden"> my garden</a>.</p>
        <p>Or, check out <a href="https://write.as/tyly/">my blog</a>, which I do not post to frequently.</p>
